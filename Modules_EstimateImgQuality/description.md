1. - Noize - okay
2. - Sharpness - ok for now, in feature maybe try to use another algorythm 
3. - Artefacts - okay
4. - ~~White balance - ne ponatno~~ - It seems impossible to calculate it using standard algorithms, better to compare in auto white balance in graphic editor
5. - Clipping - okay, but I've split into two separate algorithms for convenience 
6. - ExposeAndContrast - okay, but I've split into two separate algorithms for convenience. Maybe in the future, try to use another calculating method for the estimate of exposure (right now, using average brightness)
~~7. - Chrominance Noise - okay, but I'm not sure if it works well; maybe it's useless, and I will refuse it.~~ 
8. - ~~Moire - ne ponatno~~
